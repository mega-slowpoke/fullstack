    /* 1. public: can be accessed from anywhere
     *    private: cannot be accessed from outside
     *    protected: can be accessed from derived classes
     *    internal: can be accessed from the same assembly
     *    protected internal: from the current assembly or from types that are derived from the containing class
     *    private protected:  types derived from the containing class, but only within its containing assembly
     * 2. static : owned by the class and shared by all objects of this class
     *    const: indicates it is a const and cannot be modified
     *    readonly: the field can only
     * 3. create and initialize an object
     * 4. it allows the definition of a class, struct, or interface to be split across multiple files
     *    so work can be shared among different groups
     * 5. it just a combination of a bunch of variables
     * 6.
     * 7. overload: multiple methods with the same name and different parameters
     *    override: derived class overwrite a method of the base class
     * 8. field is just a variable while property is the field + getter and setter
     * 9. give it a default value in the signature
     * 10. interface is an agreement classes implementing the interface must follow,
     *      all methods in it shouldn't have implementation body.
     *      In abstract class, implementation bodies are allowed
